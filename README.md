tesconnectFOUR
==============

THe tesconnectFOUR is the Taipei European School media team, in which we try to connect our school (four sections) to one
using media. The tesconnectFOUR team is split into journalism, Photography, Videography, and Web design. This git repository
currently consists of nothing. However, the plans are to add all code to this git repository to colabarate in a much easier
way than normal.
